## WEEK 01
### 1. [The Complete Linux Course: Beginner to Power User](https://youtu.be/wBp0Rb-ZJak)
This is the video which showcases the entirety of linux within 7 hours! Even though it was a long video i watched it and learned basically almost everything about linux. Very compact and informative!

## WEEK 02
### 1. [Cyber Security Full Course for Beginner](https://youtu.be/U_P23SqJaDc)
This is a video I watched almost fully. I learned almost everything there is to understand about cyber security. I think that this video is very helpful in the field of IT security and operating systems. If you are interested in this field of computer science I highly recommend watching it!

## WEEK 03
### 1. [The Linux Experience](https://youtu.be/8WkcLwXCFJQ?si=DG2HikQRPaGWstIH)
Very fun video I watched about linux that can be very relatable for beginners. Since Linux for beginners can be quite frightening and hard to navigate through I found this very humorous and educational at the same time! For people who are just getting into Linux its a very fun and compact video to watch. Highly recommend.

## WEEK 04
### 1. [60 Linux Commands you NEED to know (in 10 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd7BXuUQ91w)
Very compact and informative video about linux commands. Highly recommend if you're just trying to get by the basics of linux commands. May need to rewind sometimes because of just how fast things go in this video.

### 2. [Introduction to Linux and Basic Linux Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVquJh3DXUA)
After watching the previous video, I can say that this one is a much more detailed and slow one. If you're the type of person that prefers slow learning and step by step videos this one is very suited for you. Personally this video wasnt for me.

## WEEK 05
### 1. [100+ Linux Things you Need to Know](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKCVKw9CzFo)
Compact video about fun facts in linux. You can watch it in your spare time if you want some educational content on your free time. Quite humorous too.

### 2. [The mind behind Linux | Linus Torvalds | TED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8NPllzkFhE)
Some brief history about the guy behind the operating system we know and love! Other than knowing how something works its also important to know how it was created. It opened up my perspective about linux after watching this video.

## WEEK 06
### 1. [Docusaurus: Documentation Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yhyx7otSksg)
This video is a whole introduction towards Docusaurus. Its very informative as it first tells you what it is and proceeds to tell you what features it has. This video also shows just how versatile and good Docusaurus. It even gives tutorials for the basic stuff.

## WEEK 07
### 1. [Build a Markdown Documentation Site with Docusaurus (Step-by-Step)](https://youtu.be/2R53Y7eP45k?si=ADEXOlAc1aki8ahz)
I liked this video cause its a basic tutorial about making a markdown documentation site in Docusaurus. I had problems navigating through Docusaurus at first but after watching this video it really helped me out. Now I developed a new found interest in Docusaurus! Thank you!

## WEEK 08
### 1. [Linux from Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oV541sgHKGo)
This is a livestream video about LFS (Linux From Scratch) and other than Kernotex's video this was also helpful because he also had an interactive chat that asked him questions and told him to do stuff. Despite being it a 2 hour long video it was fun to watch. Just like this weeks criteria he also reached part 5 of the document.
