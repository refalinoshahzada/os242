## WEEK 01
### 1. [The Complete Linux Course: Beginner to Power User](https://youtu.be/wBp0Rb-ZJak)
This is the video which showcases the entirety of linux within 7 hours! Even though it was a long video i watched it and learned basically almost everything about linux. Very compact and informative!

## WEEK 02
### 1. [Cyber Security Full Course for Beginner](https://youtu.be/U_P23SqJaDc)
This is a video I watched almost fully. I learned almost everything there is to understand about cyber security. I think that this video is very helpful in the field of IT security and operating systems. If you are interested in this field of computer science I highly recommend watching it!

## WEEK 03
### 1. [The Linux Experience](https://youtu.be/8WkcLwXCFJQ?si=DG2HikQRPaGWstIH)
Very fun video I watched about linux that can be very relatable for beginners. Since Linux for beginners can be quite frightening and hard to navigate through I found this very humorous and educational at the same time! For people who are just getting into Linux its a very fun and compact video to watch. Highly recommend.

## WEEK 04
### 1. [60 Linux Commands you NEED to know (in 10 minutes)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd7BXuUQ91w)
Very compact and informative video about linux commands. Highly recommend if you're just trying to get by the basics of linux commands. May need to rewind sometimes because of just how fast things go in this video.

### 2. [Introduction to Linux and Basic Linux Commands for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVquJh3DXUA)
After watching the previous video, I can say that this one is a much more detailed and slow one. If you're the type of person that prefers slow learning and step by step videos this one is very suited for you. Personally this video wasnt for me.
