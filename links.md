## WEEK 01
### 1. [The Complete Linux Course: Beginner to Power User](https://youtu.be/wBp0Rb-ZJak)
This is the video which showcases the entirety of linux within 7 hours! Even though it was a long video i watched it and learned basically almost everything about linux. Very compact and informative!

## WEEK 02
### 1. [Cyber Security Full Course for Beginner](https://youtu.be/U_P23SqJaDc)
This is a video I watched almost fully. I learned almost everything there is to understand about cyber security. I think that this video is very helpful in the field of IT security and operating systems. If you are interested in this field of computer science I highly recommend watching it!

## WEEK 03
### 1. [The Linux Experience](https://youtu.be/8WkcLwXCFJQ?si=DG2HikQRPaGWstIH)
Very fun video I watched about linux that can be very relatable for beginners. Since Linux for beginners can be quite frightening and hard to navigate through I found this very humorous and educational at the same time! For people who are just getting into Linux its a very fun and compact video to watch. Highly recommend.
